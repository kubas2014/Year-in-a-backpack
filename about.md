### The trip
{: .center}

Since about 3 years ago, we started slowly talking about going around the world - year in a backpack was born. The idea behind this adventure is to satisfy our curious minds that put us on this journey to America and Asia (but who knows what happens?). We came up with a rough plan of places we'd like to see and you can see them below

We are starting in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, spending about a month there and making our way either down to Patagonia (following the Argentinian border with Chile) or short-cutting straight to Chile. Following up on the west coast, we'd travel through the likes of Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia. From there, it would be great to visit Mexico and Cuba before getting to States. Enough planning, our plan is not to have a plan.

### Jakub and Simon

We are two czech boys from Prague who decided to travel for one year. Jakub is a fresh Bristol graduate, pretty happy when with his backpack and discovering something somewhere. Simon has recently opened up a bar in Prague with his friends - he's always happy to grab beer and meet with new people.
