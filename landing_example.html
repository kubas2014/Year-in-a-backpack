    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>We first dreamed about travelling the world in a van some three years ago, in 2013. Dream big or go home so here we are today with our backpacks, discovering the beauty of America from South to North and later (hopefully) Asia.</p>

	<p>We left home on the 22nd October 2016 and flew to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where our adventure began. Since then, we've been travelling through Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, it's already been 2 months! Next, we are going to Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ekvador and Colombia. Our plans change everyday, so who knows where we go next. You can see where we currently are here!</p>
    
	<p>We are travelling on a low budget. We sleep in a tent, in the wild nature, behind gas stations, in people's gardens and occassionally in campsites. In cities, we stay in cheap hostels. So far, we were lucky to meet good people who let us stay at their homes and helped us to get around (many thanks to all of you who gave us a ride). 
    We buy most of our food from the supermarket and cook it ourselves on a DIY camping stove made from beer cans. 
        Of course, we also want to taste the local cuisine so every now and then, we treat ourselves with a good meal in a small town restaurant, fresh bread from bakeries, street food or some ice cream, good coffee or fresh juice. 
        We find that transport is cumbersome in South America. There isn't a great infrastructure of public transportation (no trains) and you have to get around in rather expensive buses or planes. The distances are huge and the prices are higher than back home (transport is almost 50% of our costs), so we try to save money by hitchhiking, which is much longer but also more fun than taking buses - we get to chat with locals in Spanish and quite often, these rides end up being an unexpected adventure! We travel by walking, hitchhiking, buses, ferries, planes. We got a ride from a taxi driver, church charity, public bus, farmers, couples, a few truck drivers... 
    </p>
    <p>Without sponsors. At first, we wanted to get sponsorship because we thought we had very little money for such a trip. We decided to give it a shot and live cheap (getting out of your comfort zone). We travel from money we made by working in Europe, if we run out of money, we'd simply work away or come back home, that's the worst thing that can happen. In the end, we realised sponsors would be a burden and this is foremost a trip for ourselves and our friends, families. Corporations don't need to be everywhere...  Our true sponsors are the people that help us during our trip. See them all here!</p>
    
    <p>We travel light. At the same time we condemned sponsorship, we decided to take only the things we really need. We didn't buy expensive electronics and only took what we already owned. That saved us a lot of money in the beginning and we won't be so sad when we loose something. For more information about our gear, look here.</p>
    <p>We'd like to share our travel experience with you on this blog, keep an eye on new stories, images, videos and more from our journey. Cheers, Kuba and Simon</p>
