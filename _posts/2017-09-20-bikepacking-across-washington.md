I only spent little time in Washington State this time. Why? 6 years ago, I spent one year studying in the Tri Cities. I was running out of time as well as I needed to make it to Shambhala festival in about 3 weeks.

After all this time, it was more than time to come back to say hello. It was a nice welcome, I was staying with my host family at Bret's house where I had my own suite (wow)! Paddleboarding down the Columbia river, family dinner and pub crawling with Kyle were the highlights of my time here. But most of all, I could relax a little bit as well.

I spent nearly 4 days in Tri-Cities and Bret with Corinn were so nice to take me up to Yakima, which saved me about 2 days of cycling and pain (through the desert).

When we bid farewell, I stood on the foot of Mt. Rainier, an impressive volcano near Seattle. I went on a short hike there and was gradually but slowly going north, through Seattle city and Whidbey Island. During my travel here, I stayed at Corinn's wonderful grandparents whose hospitality was extraordinary.

The pacific Northwest is a beautiful place and I'm sure it deserves more time. It's just that my mind was akready set about Canada and I really needed a change.
