So has anything changed? Oh yes! It feels a little more like Europe in America - they've got kilometers and narrower roads to begin with. Seem to be also more eco-minded, but in an American way. Otherwise, it's exactly the same.

I entered British Columbia's farmland, flat and hot these days. I didn't expect Canada to be like this - I imagined mountains, lakes, glaciers, wildlife. I entered the land of my imagination when I got pass Hope, a peaceful gateway town to the mountains.

Have a look of what the ride from the border to the city of Merritt looks like!
