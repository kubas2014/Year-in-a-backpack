description: "Before hopping to Bolivia, we spent two short days in Humahuaca, where we visited the incredible Quebrada de Humahuaca including mountain of 14 colours. Jujuy has also treated us with some great food and culture."

Huge cactuses (or trees?!) everywhere

For lunch, we went to the market for the tasty traditional Machata soup and Moldon (on the right)
