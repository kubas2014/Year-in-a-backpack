I'm on my way to Laos on a overfilled sleeper bus, but I cannot sleep since the narrow winding mountain road we drive in fog and rain doesn't reinforce my sense of security. I'll try to forget it by writing something about somewhere nice.. and yes I'm thinking about you, Thailand! 

Why Thailand? Because for many, it's the gateway to Asia:
1) Bangkok is a major airline hub w/ cheap flights 
2) Thailand offers free visa to many nations 
3) Everything about Thailand is amazing - people, nature, culture and food.
All in all, the country has a lot to offer. However, there are a few "BUTs".

## It's too touristy
Thailand was discovered a long time ago and you're one of the many tourists (or travelers) who just got outta plane. The majority is here for the same reason: vacation. Therefore, you are very likely go to the same places in Bangkok and the rest of the country. Your itinerary maybe looks like this: BKK Chinatown, Backpacker street, Ayutthaya, Ko Phi Phi, Ko Phangan, Ko Samui, Phukhet, Krabi.. Almost everyone goes to one of the beach towns/resort to experience Thailand like on the pictures!

And then you're enjoying a beer with some backpackers who've been everywhere in Asia and you hear them complaining about Thailand being "too expensive and touristy". I met many of them, who suggested Thailand is simply not the place to be! In their eyes, the country got destroyed by tourism. While some of it might be true, I left the country with a much better opinion, so let me shortly explain why Thailand is still worth it.

## Thailand is comparatively developed

Compared to other countries in the region, Thailand benefits from better (tourist) infrastructure and services. To almost anywhere in the country, you can choose to travel by plane, bus, train or car/minibus, with tickets available and bookable online. When you book with a reputable agent, you'll get from point A to B with no problems and in comfort. Put simply, the services they offer work well and you mostly get what you pay for. This is very relaxing in a region where English is not so widely spoken. I heard bad stories too: some people getting robbed on a night bus, dropped off in the middle of nowhere but this doesn't happen frequently.

Accommodation options cater to all kind of traveler - you get to choose from cheap ass backpacker huts to luxurious all inclusive hotels. The standards are how you expect them to be, no surprises (and if so, very few). You can book almost everything using Booking.com or Agoda (my SE Asia favourite!). If you're on a budget, you can stay in simple yet comfortable bungalows/hammocks/hostels with cold shower for a few bucks (3$); midrange backpacker choices with prices between 3-6$ will get you a comfy bed plus hot shower, sometimes including breakfast; from $15, you can get a decent private room. I haven't stayed in anything fancier, but the more you're willing to pay, the more you get - exclusive beach and swimming pool access, huge breakfast, daily housekeeping services, gym and anything else you might desire.

Thai holiday certainly isn't boring. There are many adventure activities you can do -  kayaking, canoeing, hiking, diving, snorcheling... You can buy a tour package everywhere, on spot. If you haven't had enough, head out to glorious bars, famous Full Moon parties, tattoo salons or spend a night out in Bangkok and try to survive! Many will find what they search for and many will find their paradise here.

Beautiful destinations in Thailand are accessible. Famous destinations are crowded, touristy because almost anyone visiting Thailand includes them in their itinerary - especially backpackers complaining about it. On the plus side, this is something what makes Thailand such a backpacker hub - you'll simply meet a lot of likeminded people from all over the world. However, come low season when these places are empty and you'll enjoy Thailand almost on your own, weather permitting (it can be too hot or rain a bit). 

## Everything about Thailand has been discovered

Not quite so. For inspiration, have a look at Lonely Planet - the places mentioned are certainly worth a shot, but don't expect to discover something "off the beaten path" as millions of travelers like you are reading the same guide and planning accordingly. I'd suggest you download the sample version of the e-book on your smartphone and glimpse at the regions and POI to have a broad overview in your mind.

Having said that, Thailand has so much more to offer, depending on what you like. There are developed as well as unspoiled options here: islands/beaches to go to, lively cities or towns no one has ever heard of, an infinity of buddhist temples to visit, diverse natural landscapes, extraordinary food to taste and meet ever smiling people. Thailand is an exciting gateway to Asia, it's a perfect destination for backpacker novices, experienced vacation chasers or digital nomads. There is a reason why Thailand is called a backpacker paradise.

If you're bored of being a tourist, you can become a traveler. And travel to places that are largely undiscovered. Look for small villages, get off in the middle of your train journey, go somewhere you never hear of. You'll discover a wholly different Thailand. Thailand where you'll be a stranger to the local people. Chiang Mai (or northern Thailand), far northeast, midway between BKK and Krabi are just a few ideas.

On the way back to Bangkok from the southern islands, I was stopping at random towns along the way and I was blown away. This was certainly the best part of my Thai trip. Hustling night markets, magnificient street performances and festivals in small towns, curious locals asking me if they could practice their English with me just to name a few. These are the unique experiences you have to seek on your own, something which makes travel very rewarding and valuable.

Slow down, western life rolls way too fast. Travel in the cheapest, 3rd class train. Speak with the locals, watch the passing landscape. Hop on a boat. Take your time, **travel slow**. Don't be ashamed to spend a week or more at one place. You won't see more, but you'll get better and deeper experiences. Maybe, you'll understand a bit more about the culture you came to discover.
