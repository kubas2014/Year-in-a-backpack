I was really excited to make it to Colombia finally. "Colombia is amazing. You have to go!", everyone told me. And the country superseded my expectations: hottest girls, nice nature, good food, ok beer, great coffee and a lot of mountain biking opportunities. 

We didn't see many touristy things, but we did a lot. 

We spent the first week by the swimming pools, reading, cooking, playing chess, drinking coffee and beer. Smoking weed.

Then we explored the Cafetero region, where we visited coffee farms and drank a lot of coffee.

Then we went to Medellin, where we drank rum, played tennis all day after 8 years and went to the Museum of Modern Art.

We then made it to Girardot, a small town with a lot of top-end hotel resorts. We went to a discotheque on the top of a gas station and then to a posh pool party with house music.

Now we're in the bus for Bogota, tomorrow we fly to the beach, I wanna go snorkeling. In love with Colombia.
