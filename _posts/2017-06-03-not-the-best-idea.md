Last night, I hit hard the reality of trying to backpack/hitchhike across the States, from East to West. 

I was in Miami on my own and spent a sleepless night at the airport calling with my family and friends (there was no internet in Cuba). In the morning, it was heavily raining non-stop, I decided to move to Orlando by bus. I thought there'd be less rain and some cheap place to crash at so that I could just start hitchhiking the next day. 

I was right about the rain, but wrong about everything else. What happened instead was that I got to Orlando, walked around and couldn't find any reasonable motel/hostel/campsite, just expensive hotels charging over $100 a night, way out of my budget. I started going around churches and the Salvation Army, but they were all closed or didn't really want to help. They were all afraid, told me they trust no one and that they cannot help me. I then tried 7/11 and some 24hr places but I was told I cannot stay on the premises for longer than the time needed for shopping. Then a homeless black guy offered to show me some cheap place but as we were leaving the city center to more shady areas, suddenly I was in this part of town called the ghetto. Realizing this, I turned him down and walked off the other way to a safer part of the city. By this point, I was quite desperate, I didn't have a place to sleep, I had no plan, didn't know what to do. Wild camping was out of question, that'd be trespassing. I was in racist, xenophobic, sketchy Orlando, where people don't trust each other.

I decided it'd be best to just walk it out. All I wanted to do was getting on a plane to the west coast to see my friends there. 

As I was walking, a car pulled over and the guy asked me if I needed a ride, it was already past midnight. I told him I do not because I have nowhere to go and that I don't really see how he could help. He said he can help and told me I can crash at his house. He seemed to be a nice guy, so I took his offer and got in his red Ford truck. 

I spent last night at his house, he offered me beer and we watched Billy Elliot. He's been taking me around the city making sure I have a good time. Telling me Orlando's history So nice. In shit situations, good people show up and save you. Thank you Dennis! 

So tonight, my plans changed. I'm no longer going to hitchhike across the US, that was a stupid plan I guess. It's too hot, too dangerous and too hard. I'm getting a plane either tomorrow, flying over to the West coast baby! So excited :)
