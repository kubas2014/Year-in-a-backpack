Last night, I hard hit the reality of trying to backpack across the States, hitchhike from East to West. 

I was in Miami on my own, it was raining a lot so I decided to move to Orlando by bus where I thought there'll be less rain and some cheap place to crash at so that I could just go to the highway the next day and get on a truck.

What happened instead was that I got to Orlando, walked around and couldn't see any motel, just expensive hotels charging over $100 a night, way out of my budget. I started going around churches and the Salvation Army, but they were all closed or didn't really want to help.  
I then tried 7/11 and some 24hr places but they told me I can't stay on the premises for longer than the time required to do shopping. Then a homeless black guy offered to show me some cheap place but as we were leaving the city center to more shady areas, I turned him down and started going around the city on my own. I was quite desperate.

I decided it'd be best to just walk all night long, wait until the morning and then get on a plane to the west coast to see my friends. As I was walking, a car pulled over and asked me if I needed a ride, it was already midnight. I told him I do not because I have nowhere to go and that I don't really see how he could help me. He said he can help and told me I can crash at his house. He seemed to be a nice guy, so I took his offer. 

I spent last night at his house, he offered me beer and we watched Billy Elliot. He's taking me around the city making sure I have a good time. So nice. In shit situations, good people show up and save you. Thank you Dennis! 

So I'm no longer going to hitchhike across the US, that was a stupid plan I guess. It's too hot, too dangerous and too hard. I'm getting a plane either tomorrow or Monday, flying over to the West coast baby :)
