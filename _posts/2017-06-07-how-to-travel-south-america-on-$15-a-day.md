description: "Before we set off, we were told to prepare for South America being expensive. So we did, we took a tent, camping gear and were ready for a bit of discomfort in order to fit in our budget. The worst thing to happen was to run out of cash and go home. That didn't happen and today, 7 months later, we can share our experience and some tips & tricks on cheap but fun travel!  "

Each country has its specifics when it comes to saving money, meaning that just like each of them has a national dish, each has its own ways of living cheap. While everyone says South America is expensive, we manage to live well for a long term average of around $15/day. You can obviously go up with the budget to luxurious $30/day or cut it down to less than $5-10 just like the street performers or travellers-workers, often artists, who sell their art. It's up to you how you want to travel and where the limits of your comfort zone lie.

## 3 big expenses

There are 3 biggest expenses for travellers: you need to eat, get around and sleep. You should forget about eating in restaurants in expensive countries (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile) or sleeping in hostels sometimes even paying the campsites at over $10 a night (Brazil, Chile, Argentina). In cheap countries like Bolivia, Peru, Cuba or Mexico, you can afford eating out, staying in hostels and taking buses. Getting around can be a considerable expense so it makes sense to plan the route ahead, look for cheap routes and cover most distance on these services (for example, Buenos Aires has cheap buses to Mendoza, Bariloche or Salta) or simply hitchhike as there are trucks doing long haul routes and they take you quite far (Chile). 

## The tips

- take overnight buses, saves you 1 night, gives you a full day of worryless exploration (you can often leave your backpack with the company)

- book one night in cities, get 2 days for exploring, leave your stuff at the hostel. You have to leave the bed before noon, but use the facilities both days (toilet/shower/lockers)!

- shop at supermarkets, cook your own food (in some countries like Bolivia, Peru, Mexico or Cuba this is unnecessary as it's cheaper to eat out). Find marketplaces to shop for groceries and fresh fruits/veggies (Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, Cuba) or fruit/veg shops (Argentina or Brazil)

- meet local people: they will tell you where to eat, sleep or even invite you to sleep at their house (doesn't apply for Cuba!)

- share a beer with travelers to exchange tips on what to do or tourist traps, meet new friends or travel partners

- bring a tent, hike, sleep in the nature and don't pay for accommodation (largely done in Argentina where we only paid for 4 nights in our 1,5 months there)

- find campsites for free or ask people whether you can stay in their garden (Argentina)

- take buses, hitchhike, walk around (many people tell you things are far but only a few blocks away in reality)

- take buses at terminals, where you have bargaining power. Don't go with the first company. Sometimes it's worth paying more for comfort (overnight buses)

- the best deals are not always online, ask "offline" as well! (That lady cooking home made food, that family guesthouse…). We book in advance when going to a big city, it's usually cheaper and safer to know about a place (it's a bad idea to wander about a South American city you don't know, might as well get to a bad part of town very quickly).

- alcohol is generally expensive, but each country has its national booze. There's very cheap wine in Argentina and Chile. Cheap pisco in Bolivia and Peru. Rum in Colombia, Cuba or cachaça in Brazil. Tequila in Mexico. Beer is rather expensive.

- always agree on the price before boarding the bus/micro/taxi and try to negotiate. Know the real price, if not sure, ask locals who are not interested in selling you expensive, try multiple companies/people to get an idea about the price (we go to them by giving them the price for which we're willing to go). This avoids unnecessary rip offs and disappointment.

- have some smaller change. Especially true for Cuba, you think you've agreed on the price, but they might try scamming you telling you the price is per person not for the two of you, once you hand the bill over, it's too late.

- look for places crowded with people or queues, a queue means people are waiting for something cheap and usually good. The empty places are generally more expensive.

-  book plane tickets well in advance, there's considerable savings here

- bargaining skills. Don't be afraid to cut the price by 2 or even by 25 times (yes this is how much more they want to charge foreigners in Cuba!). Walk off, they will usually run after you with a much better deal (taxis, collectivos). If travelling off peak, you know you are pulling at the longer side of the cord, and you can get significant discounts (true for accommodation in Cuba where we manage 50% off or hostel for the price of camping in Brazil). In some countries you can bargain more (Peru, Cuba) in others, the discounts are not that significant (Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina or Brazil). 

- take out the tour operators. Not only are you more free but this saves you so much money. Some people even go in for advice and then do it on their own. For example, we were able to do the Salkantay trek in Peru with our own equipment for less than 1/5 the cost of the tour agencies, doing exactly the same itinerary including transport (public microbus).

- your own gear. When you wanna go snorkeling, buy your gear at the supermarket, the price will usually be cheaper than renting it for a day. You can sell it after you're done using it. The same goes for hiking or camping gear.

## Don't forget

Last but not least, have fun! Low budget shouldn't block you from enjoying your travel, on the contrary, it should enable you to have a great time anywhere you go and put you in situations where you meet a lot of incredible people!
