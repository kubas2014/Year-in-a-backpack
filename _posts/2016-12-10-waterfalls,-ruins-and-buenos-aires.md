description: "We walked across the border to Argentinian Puerto Iguazu, where we admired the fabulous Iguacu waterfalls, one of 7 natural wonders of the world. We learned how to make Yerba Mate and got addicted to it. Visited some ruins. Slept by a drug-traffic river. Went out in Buenos Aires."

On Ilha Grande we have met a couple from Rio De Janeiro and decided to take up on their offer to stop by at their place on the way to Iguacu instead of spending another night on unknown gas station. We spent another two nights in Rio and then got to our 28hour bus to Iguacu. When we arrived to Foz do Iguacu we had no cash for the bus so we had to walk over the border to Argentina, it took us ~4 hours and it was raining a lot :)

## Iguacu waterfalls

The next day we went to see the famous Iguacu waterfalls and it was incredible. You can walk to see the devil's throat on a ramp over the water that is over a kilometer long, when you get there it is incredible, the amount of water falling down is huge and you end up wet from the mist.

Then you can walk under the falls on different routes and also go by a boat to an island in the middle or if you pay they will take you under the waterfalls themselves. We spent the whole day there and it was well worth it !

## The journey south and San Ignacio

In the evening  Argentinian buskers that were at the same hostel invited us to have a joint with them. We learned a lot about Argentinian folk music and they told us that hitchhiking in Argentina is easy. So the next morning we started our way south to Buenos Aires. After a whole day hitchhiking we got ~40 kms far and camped by a fruit stand by the road. They told us the trucks go early in the morning.

 We got up around 4 but first guy that took us was around 9 and it was a 10km ride. Then on a gas station they told us it's some kind of holidays again so we took a bus to see San Ignacio. There are ruins of a Jesuit mission from the 17th century. It is an UNESCO site and it was interesting to learn some of the history. We were told we can camp by the river on a beach nearby so we spent the night there.

The next day we  went to see another ruin that is not that well preserved nearby and it was actually way nicer !

## Buenos Aires

We took an overnight bus to Buenos Aires. In the morning we had some trouble finding the airbnb we booked, but on the way we walked through the centre which was nice. We sat down for the city's classic café con crema y medialunas (small croissants).

After lunch we took a bus to see their park (Reserva Ecológica Costanera Sur) on an island East from the city centre. 

The bay the city is in is actually a river and not a bay, which we did not realize before. So the water is still fresh and brown. We walked through the port and the old city and realised that the city is much more European then the others we saw so far. On the way home we stopped by a really nice coffee place called La Poesía and San Telmo market. 

The next day we walked through the Palermo district, had a great coffee at a proper hipster place, which the district is full of and we got a lunch deal with a glass of wine, starter, main course and a desert which was great. 

In the evening we went to a local cultural centre where local bands were playing and it was great.

The next day, we headed over to Uruguay. We were meant to take a train, which was cancelled, so had to take a scenic train along the coast to Tigre. It was beautiful, along the coast were parks with kiosks, open-air bars, cycle paths full of people doing an Asado (bbq) or just chilling. Definitely worth seeing :) After a hamburger and super pancho (hot dog), we boarded our ferry for Uruguay!
