I chose to take the road less traveled, along Mabel Lake to escape the traffic (and smoke). While I was successful in meeting no traffic but one car in the entire day, smoke was still everywhere.

It pursued me all the way through the gateway to the Rockies such as Glacier NP (all covered in smoke), Golden city (heavy smoke) that I hitchbiked the last 40km stretch to Yoho to avoid breathing air quality worse than China.

When I got to Yoho in the end, it was still smoky. It was a beautiful evening, however, as I camped out in the woods by a beautiful lake, watching Elk coming there to drink. I was more lucky on the second day as the skies cleared up and I could enjoy incredible panoramic views from the amazing 25km Iceline Trail, which I decided to hike today.
