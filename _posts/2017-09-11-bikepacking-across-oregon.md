Oregon surprised me by the diversity of its landscapes - vulcanic mountains vs. flatout farmland, infinite forests, wetlands and lakes vs. desert, wild wilderness vs. typical  american towns, not forget the beautiful seaside and coastal rainforests.

It felt a little like Europe and it definitely felt like being in nature. Even Portland didn't put the impression of a mega city, but a city in the forest instead. Oregon was everything I was looking for. 

Moreover, its people were incredible, smiling, supporting and overall helpful. I felt welcomed and had a great time in Oregon. I was stopped and asked many times what I was doing and why, congratulated in my effort, given energy bars, cold beer, dinner or help when I needed it.

Oregon has a lot of culture and great food in the typically weird Portland. It has great mountain biking and beer. It's my favourite out of all the United States.

Here's a video from all the cycling (only in Czech at the moment), followed by photos ordered chronologically, from Klamath Falls up to Bend via Crater Lake, down to the coastal towns of Newport up to Cannon Beach and back onto mainland to Portlandia.
